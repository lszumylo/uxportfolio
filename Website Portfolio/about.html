<h2 class="Hello">Hello,<br> a bit about me</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<div>
<p>For as long as I can remember, my life has always included creativity. As a
child, I dressed up playing pretend which provided as an outlet, every day I
became someone or something new. When I got older, drawing, creative
writing, ceramics and photography became my new form of expression, but
with them also came restrictions, criticism, and boundaries to overcome.</p>
<br>
<p>My first camera was a pink, 110 manual advance with bulb flash, which taught
 me about composition light and detail. Throughout my life, my love of
 photography stuck with me and I found my passion.</p>
<br>
<p>I embarked on a 15-year career as a Professional Photographer after
graduating from Hallmark Institute of Photography.</p>
<br>
<p>As the industry changed from paper to pixels so did my career goals. This
 change inspired me to expand my creativity into Web Design, Marketing,
 Visual and UX Design.</p>
<br>
<p>My new career path proved to be both fascinating and challenging, as my
 toolbox changed from photo lenses and backdrops to typefaces, and design
 programs my new creative outlet was born!</p>
<br>
<p>Today I strive to create projects that are unique and inspiring, true to their
 purpose, and most of all user-friendly.</p>
<br>
<p>I would love to help with your next project. <a href="contact.html"><strong>Let's Talk!</strong></a></p>
