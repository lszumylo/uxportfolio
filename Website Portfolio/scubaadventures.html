  <h2 class="problem">The Problem</h2>
<br>

<p class="sample">Unless you know where you want to dive or are staying at a diving resort there<br> aren't
many options for booking and researching dive locations efficiently.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2 class="solution">The Solution</h2>
<br>

<p class="explanation">Scuba Adventures, an ecommerce site that offers exceptional diving and liveaboard
  rates worldwide. They offer expert information on the dive sites, country<br>requirements and general information.
  The rates are comparable to each specific location so the consumer doesn't need to worry about overpaying on diving rates.</p>

          <p class="swo">Scuba Diving is a great way to explore the world we live in, with so many locations and
         diving types available it would take several lifetimes to see it all. Today's technology
         allows you to book your next excursion in minutes and explore your dive site within hours.
         <br>
         <br>

        Based on the survey results, we took a deeper look into 3 Scuba Diving Companies to see
        what they offered, who their target market is, how they are similar to each other and what
        made them different in the diving market. Listing out their strengths and weaknesses will
        help see if our site can stand out against the competition. Let's dive in!</p>

<p class="crossover-stories">I created 2 sets of user stories, the first to show what users expected to see<br> on a dive

      <div class="user-testing-container">

  <h2 class="user-testing">User Testing</h2>

  <p class="test">There were three users testing the Scuba Adventures website, 1 male and 2 female.<br>
      The ages ranged from mid-20's to late 40's. All of the users tested on a desktop. <br>
      Each tester completed all 3 tasks and the process was approximately 10 minutes long
      from start to finish.</p>

       <h2 class="results-summary">Results Summary</h2>

      <p class="question1">How would you book a diving trip?</p>
      <p class="question2">How would you submit a quote?</p>
      <p class="question3">Show me where you would go to add a review?</p>
      <br>

       <h3 class="problem1">Problem #1</h3>

      <p class="problem1-explanation">The main usability issue that all 3 users came across was
        the misunderstanding of what the "Reservation" tab did. When asked how to book a reservation,
       all 3 of the testers went to the "Reservation" tab at the top of the screen. This wasn't
       clickable yet because my thought process was to go here to review your purchase. All 3 users
       were using it as a way to book a new reservation instead of to "check" a reservation that you
       already have.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="problem2">Problem #2</h3>

      <p class="problem2-explanation">A minor, but important concern was brought to my attention when
      one user wasn't sure if the message they left was received by the company, as there wasn't
      any indication that it went through. The same problem occurred on the "submit a quote" task
      the user did not know if the quote had gone to the company.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="result">Results</h3>

      <p class="results-explanation">All 3 users did work through the screens and were able to get through the booking
      process without any major problems. The workflow process was straight forward and
      simple to understand.</p>
      <br>

        <h3 class="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

      <p class="thoughts-explanation">There are definitely things that need to be fixed and reworked. I felt that the users
      were happy with the overall experience and did prove they were able to work through the issues
      to find another way of getting the answers they were looking for.
      <br>
      <br>

       I will fix the major issues that all 3 users had, change how somethings are structured
      and worded to make it clear as to what each tab is supposed to have or support. I will
      then retest to see if the changes improved the outcome.</p>

              <br>
              <h3 class="typography">Typography</h3>

              <p class="typography-explanation">Originally I had selected Roboto as my typography but when I was working with the logo
                it didn't work well with Gabriela. I then changed to Muli for the site and also the logo but
                decided the logo needed its own font. The final selection is Open Sans for the site as it
                has multiple font styles and Muli will remain as the logo.</p>

                    <h3 class="what-worked">What Worked & What Didn't</h3>


                    <p class="worked-explanation">Overall the site I feel is a success, the goals of the site were fullfilled,the
                  users were able to complete the tasks and liked the look and feel of the site.

                  I had to redesign a few things along the way, either the process was too long for
                    the consumer to complete correctly or the idea didn't go with the goals of either the
                  user or the business</p>

                  <h3 class="project-concerns">Project Concerns</h3>


                    <p class="project-explanation">I didn't really have any concerns going into the project. I chose this topic because
                       I am passionate about diving and travel. I wanted to create a site that will help make
                       these two things easier for people who are looking for their next adventure.</p>

                       <h3 class="surprised">What Surprised Me & What I Would Improve</h3>


                      <p class="surprised-explanation">How quickly this topic can branch out allowing you to add more information then
                       you planned in the beginning. I had to remind myself of the original outline
                      and what the users wanted, not what I felt they needed.

                      <br>

                      I would make sure each destination I had listed would show at least one
                         diving location and complete the country facts.</p>


                      <h3 class="better-me">Designing A Better Me</h3>

                      <p class="better-me-explanation">I need to double the time I think it will take to complete tasks, as I am not
                          as fast as I wish to be. I am also a perfectionist and I have a hard time submitting
                          work that I don't feel is good enough, so instead of getting feeback I will waste time
                          redesigning instead of letting it go for feedback.

                         I had a lot of fun completing this project and found creating websites to be
                            easier then mobile applications.

                        Moving forward I plan on keeping a timer near me to keep me at my pace
                          and also accept that it won't be correct the first time. The sooner I submit
                          the work the quicker I will learn and will be a better designer.</p>
